# Self-Leaning-AI
An AI that is able to learn with no human inputs.
This script appears to be a Python class called "App" that is designed to train and test an AI model for a board game. The class initializes with a specified model and a desired depth of training, and has methods for setting the random seed, compiling the model with specific parameters, configuring the training process, and saving the current state of the training process to a file. Additionally, it uses a "Logger" class to track and output information about the training process, and a "ContinuousPlotWindow" class to display a graph of the training process' loss over time.
it appears that the AI is trained using a self-play mechanism, where the AI plays against itself to learn and improve its decision-making abilities. The "Trainer" class is used to train the AI by playing multiple games of the board game against itself, and the "AI" class is used to make decisions and update the model based on the outcomes of the games. Human input is not explicitly used in the training process.
